You have entered -h so the following lines will help you through the parameters for Simpletron's
compilation.

* -m :
    the argument next to "-m" is the amount of memory you request for Simpletron (only integers).
    If you don't enter the parameter, the default amount is 50 words, meaning word as an
    instruction. You may enter at most 100 words.

* -i :
    if you enter "-i" the following parameter is the name of a file from which the words will be
    read. If you don't enter this parameter, the words will be read from stdin (usually your
    keyboard).

* -if :
    next to "-if" parameter there are two paths to follow. If you wish that the words to be read
    are to be represented by a binary sequence, type "-if bin"; if you wish that the words are to
    be read as a sequence of decimal numbers, enter "-if txt". Only enter this parameter if there
    is a file to be read, not stdin. The default argument is txt.

* -o :
    if you wish for the dump (the program summary) to be stored in a file, enter "-o <filename>".
    If you don't enter this parameter, the dump will be printed in stdout (your screen).

* -of :
    next to "-of" parameter you have two choices: either you enter "-of bin" for the dump to be
    printed in a binary sequence, or "-of txt" for the dump to be printed in regular text format.
    Only enter this parameter if the dump is to be printed into a file, not stdout. The default
    argument is txt.

Examples:

./simpletron -m 33 -i instructions -if txt

./simpletron -i instructions.bin -if bin -o output.txt

./simpletron -m 11 -o output -of bin

./simpletron
